CrosspostSharp 2.2.2
====================

Source: https://github.com/libertyernie/CrosspostSharp

--------------------

CrosspostSharp is a Windows desktop application that loads individual
submissions from art sites and lets you post them to your other
accounts, maintaining the title, description, and tags.

Only visual submissions (artwork) are supported at this time.

Before trying this application, you should try PostyBirb
(http://postybirb.weebly.com/); it has more features and supports more sites.

Requirements:

* Internet Explorer 11
* .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher

Supported Sites
---------------

* DeviantArt / sta.sh
* Flickr
* FurAffinity (read-only)
* FurryNetwork
* Inkbunny
* Pixiv (read-only)
* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Weasyl (read-only)

You can also read from a local folder and save images to local files.

Additionally, you can install Java and grab [efc.jar]
(https://github.com/libertyernie/Furry-Crossposter/releases),
which will add support for posting to Weasyl, FurAffinity, and other furry sites.
efc.jar is a fork of another crossposting app, with the ability to import from
CrosspostSharp added and certain other things removed. See its page for more
information.

Logging In
----------

To use this application, you must connect it to one or more of your accounts.
Information for all accounts will be stored in the file CrosspostSharp.json,
so keep that file secure!

In most cases, you'll use the "Sign In" button in Tools -> Options to launch a
browser window, which will let you sign in using OAuth. Once signed in, the
OAuth token will be stored in CrosspostSharp.json.

When you're logged into a source site, your three most recent
submissions will appear along the left side of the window. Click the thumbnail
to load the full image and fill in the information boxes.

#### DeviantArt

You can upload images to DeviantArt or just to Sta.sh, and you can also use
either one as a source site.

#### Flickr

If you have script errors on the page while trying to sign in, close and then
restart CrossposterSharp.

#### Pixiv

Your Pixiv username and password will be stored in plaintext in CrosspostSharp.json.

#### Tumblr

Only photo posts will be shown. Reblogs will be included, but CrosspostSharp won't
allow you to post them to other sites.

#### Twitter

Retweets, and tweets without photos, will be omitted.

The browser window uses Internet Explorer internally, so you may see a notice
from Twitter that you have logged in with Internet Explorer from a new device.

#### Weasyl

You can obtain a Weasyl API key at https://www.weasyl.com/control/apikeys.
Copy the API key from the page and paste it into the Options dialog in
CrosspostSharp (Tools -> Options).

You can revoke an API key at any time by going to the same page.

Compiling from Source
---------------------

This project can be built with Visual Studio 2015 or 2017.

The file OAuthConsumer.cs is missing from the CrosspostSharp project. Get your own
OAuth keys, then put the following into OAuthConsumer.cs:

    namespace CrosspostSharp {
        public static class OAuthConsumer {
            public static class Tumblr {
                public static string CONSUMER_KEY = "consumer key goes here";
                public static string CONSUMER_SECRET = "secret key goes here";
            }
            public static class Twitter {
                public static string CONSUMER_KEY = "consumer key goes here";
                public static string CONSUMER_SECRET = "secret key goes here";
            }
            public static class DeviantArt {
                public static string CLIENT_ID = "client_id goes here";
                public static string CLIENT_SECRET = "client_secret goes here";
            }
            public static class Flickr {
                public static string KEY = "consumer key goes here";
                public static string SECRET = "secret key goes here";
            }
        }
    }
